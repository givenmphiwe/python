The user should be prompted to enter a username and password. A list of valid usernames and passwords are stored in a text file called ​user.txt​. Display an appropriate error message if the user enters a username that is not listed in​user.txt or enters a valid username but not a valid password. The user should repeatedly be asked to enter a valid username and password until they provide appropriate credentials.     

The following menu should be displayed once the user has successfully logged in:   
○ If the user chooses ​‘r’ ​to register a user, the user should be prompted for a new username and password. The user should also         be asked to confirm the password. If the value entered to confirm the password matches the value of the password, the username           and password should be written to ​user.txt in the appropriate format.
